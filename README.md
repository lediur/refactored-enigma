## What is this thing

I wrote some JavaScript a decade ago for displaying song info in foobar2000. The original code is _bad_. I wanted to make it better. This repo is me finding out exactly how much I can bend the poor JavaScript engine in the JScript Panel.

## Experiments tried so far

* Transpilation from TypeScript using a horrifying hackjob of Browserify, Babelify, Tsify, and Gulp
* Introducing Redux, because why not

## WIP and TODO

* [ ] üèÉ‚Äç A comprehensive and thorough documentation and type definition of the original JScript Panel interfaces and related documentation into TypeScript type definitions
* [ ] Figure out if I can get an existing JavaScript UI library to work with GDI
* [x] Actually make my original code work again

## Is it any good

Oh god no.
